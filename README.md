# Detection of Foreign Political Interference on Twitter
In the most recent 2016 presidential election, the United States Justice Department charged the Internet Research Agency, a Russian “troll factory”, with an accusation of running a sophisticated and coordinated campaign to sow disinformation and discord into American politics via social media [1]. The US Justice Department’s conclusion was that foreign agents, via Twitter and other social media platforms, coordinated to influence voter decisions at the polls. Our aim is to use machine learning techniques such as sentiment analysis, natural language processing, stylometric analysis etc. to identify suspicious accounts and analyze their presents in the 2016 election and surrounding politics.
